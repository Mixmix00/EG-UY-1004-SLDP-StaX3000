# StaX3000 by StaX

## StaX3000 is an automated delivery robot for boxes. StaX3000 helps small buisnesses and people save time by completing deliveries for them.

# Technology 
StaX3000 is built using a Raspberry Pi. Code runs on the Raspberry Pi, and image processsing happens there as well. OpenCV computer vision is used for processing the AprilTags.


# Replication
To replicate the StaX robot, first create a Python virtual environment.
`python3 -m venv path/to/folder/for/venv` can be used to create a venv. Then, set the source to bin/activate by excecuting `source path/to/folder/for/venv/bin/activate`. Import any neccessary pip dependencies with `python3 -m pip install your_dependency`. Clone this repo and run the code using `python3 filename.py`.
